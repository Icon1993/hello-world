# hello-world

Hello all,

Touching on what I briefly talked about in my bio I'm very excited about my decision to embark on learning programming specifically Python and eventually other languages. I know I have a long and difficult road ahead and I'm fully committed to learning and eventually appyling my newly established skillset to real world applications. 

Best regards,

Newbie
